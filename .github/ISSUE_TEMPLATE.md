### Expected behavior and actual behavior.

- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened? Include as much information as possible, such as:
  - Nature of reported defect (e.g. user name missing, not "It doesn't work."). Is it intermittent?
  - The best help here is a failing test. Even better if it's a PR.
  - Then the steps to reproduce and/or a gist or repository that demonstrates the defect.
  - Then examples of the code you were using.
  - Any error messages (including stacktrace, i.e. "Show me the error.")

### Steps to reproduce the issue (i.e. "Show me how to show myself." )

- What were you doing? Include code if possible, such as:
  - Command line parameters used, if any.
  - RubyGems code in your Gemfile, if any. Gemfile.lock, if possible.
  - Any configuration you've made.
- Things you've tried.
- Link to source code, if available.
